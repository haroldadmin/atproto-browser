ATProto Browser lets you browse files stored on the [ATProto](https://atproto.com) network.

Features:

- Browse files on any PDS using the owner's DID or Bluesky handle.
- A live feed of posts made on the Bluesky network with configurable sampling and buffer size.
- Consistent, predictable URLs that make it easy to share links.
- Rich previews for popular record types alongside raw JSON data.

ATProto Browser is a Next.js app built with React Server components. Server rendered wherever possible, with fallback to client side rendering for dynamic content.
